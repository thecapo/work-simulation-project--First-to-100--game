# work-simulation-project--First-to-100--game

a "First to 100" game vb.net forms application. The form will have two text boxes to enter the players names. Create a button to start the game. Each player will have a button that can be pressed alternatively (lock out the other player until  their turn) until one player accrues 100 points. Each time the button pressed a random number of points is added to the players score between 1 and 6 inclusive each time. Store the winning players name into an array and the score for that game in another array. Use the same index when storing the information in the two arrays to keep the winners name and score correctly related. Locking out the button after each go will prevent a player cheating by pressing twice. Hint:  to swap players, use a boolean and change the state of it when each button is pressed. This is called a toggle.

At the end of each game, update a text box with a report showing the five best and who achieved them.
